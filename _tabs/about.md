Hello, I’m **Moataz Osama** — a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about **Pentesting, Red Team operations, and Malware Development**.  
This blog is where I share **technical write-ups, deep dives, and research notes** from my journey in offensive security.  

### What you’ll find here:
- **Red Team & Pentesting Technique** – red team tactics, privilege escalation, lateral movement  
- **Malware Development Experiments** – shellcode injection, DLL hijacking, AV/EDR evasion  
- **CTF & Training Labs** – write-ups from platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox  
- **System Security** – Windows internals, Active Directory, persistence techniques  

I believe that cybersecurity is best learned through **hands-on experience and knowledge sharing**. By publishing these articles, I aim to both strengthen my own understanding and contribute back to the security community.
