**Introduction**

In this post, we’ll delve into the **Process Environment Block (PEB)**, a key structure in Windows internals, and how it relates to debugging detection mechanisms. Specifically, we’ll explore the **BeingDebugged** flag, a commonly used attribute within the PEB that reveals whether a process is being debugged. This detection technique is often leveraged for anti-reversing and anti-debugging purposes.

I’ll demonstrate how we can bypass this debugging detection by modifying the BeingDebugged flag in the PEB. We’ll walk through both an Assembly (ASM) script and a corresponding C implementation, along with a proof-of-concept image showing the patch in action.

**Section 1: Understanding the PEB and Debugging Detection**

What is the Process Environment Block (PEB)?

The **Process Environment Block (PEB)** is a data structure in Windows operating systems that stores information crucial to each process. The PEB is part of the process’s memory and provides the operating system with metadata needed for managing processes effectively. It’s located in a reserved memory area for each process, with information that includes:

**Process and Thread Identifiers**: Identifiers for managing processes and threads.

**Loaded Modules**: A list of all libraries and modules loaded by the process.

**Heap and Memory Details**: Details about the default heap and memory allocations.

**Process Flags**: Several flags indicating the state of the process, such as whether it’s a console app, critical process, or even if it’s running under a debugger.

The PEB is accessible from user-mode code, which makes it a prime target for both legitimate monitoring and anti-debugging techniques.

**What is PEB->BeingDebugged?**

One of the fields within the PEB is `BeingDebugged`, a single-byte flag that indicates if a debugger is attached to the process. When a process is being debugged, the operating system sets this flag to `1`; otherwise, it remains `0`. This flag allows processes, including malware, to detect if they’re being debugged, enabling them to:

**Evade Detection**: Malware can use this flag to avoid analysis by security researchers. If the process detects it’s being debugged, it can stop execution or change behavior, preventing the debugger from gathering accurate information.

**Modify Execution Behavior**: Software might change its behavior under debugging to prevent reverse engineering or modify the user experience during debugging.**PEB->BeingDebugged: The Debugging Detection Flag**

The BeingDebugged flag in the PEB indicates whether a process is being debugged. When a debugger attaches to a process, this flag is set to 1. Many applications use this flag to detect and respond to debugging attempts, making it a popular target for anti-reversing and anti-debugging methods.

**Why Target BeingDebugged?** Bypassing this flag is crucial in scenarios where debugging restrictions interfere with reverse engineering, allowing analysts to circumvent these protections by flipping the flag to avoid detection.

**Section 2: Patching PEB->BeingDebugged**

1.  **Concept of Patching the Debugging Flag**

*   Flipping the **BeingDebugged** flag from 1 to 0 effectively bypasses debugger detection, allowing a process to run without interference. This technique can be used for security research, reverse engineering, or malware analysis, especially when dealing with anti-debugging techniques.

2\. **Prerequisites and Setup**  
You’ll need access to an assembler (for the ASM code) and a C compiler (for the C code). Additionally, this technique is designed for **64-bit** Windows systems due to its specific use of the **rax** register and memory offsets.

**Section 3: The ASM Script**

The following ASM code demonstrates how to patch the **BeingDebugged** flag in the PEB, allowing us to bypass debugging detection.

> **.code**

> **getPEB proc**

> **mov rax, gs:\[60h\] ; PEB**

> **ret**

> **getPEB endp**

> **PEBPatcher proc**

> **xor eax, eax**

> **call getPEB**

> **movzx eax, byte ptr \[rax+2h\]; PEB->Being Debugged**

> **test eax, eax**

> **jnz PATCH**

> **ret**

> **PATCH:**

> **xor eax, eax**

> **call getPEB**

> **mov byte ptr \[rax+2h\], 0**

> **ret**

> **PEBPatcher endp**

**Code Explanation**

*   **Retrieving the PEB**: The getPEB function retrieves the PEB base address using the gs:\[60h\] instruction, which is specific to 64-bit Windows.
*   **Checking the BeingDebugged Flag**: PEBPatcher calls getPEB, then checks the BeingDebugged field (located at PEB + 0x2). If the flag is set (indicating a debugger), it jumps to the PATCH section.
*   **Patching the Flag**: In PATCH, the BeingDebugged value is set to 0, clearing any indication of an attached debugger.

**Section 4: The C Code Implementation**

This C code complements the ASM code by calling the **PEBPatcher** function if the **BeingDebugged** flag is set, allowing for seamless integration.

> **#include <Windows.h>**

> **#include <winternl.h>**

> **#include <stdio.h>**

> **extern PPEB getPEB(void);**

> **extern BYTE PEBPatcher(void);**

> **int main(int argc, char\* argv\[\]) {**

> **printf(“\[\*\] Getting the PEB “);**

> **PPEB pPEB = getPEB();**

> **printf(“\[+\] PEB is : 0x%p\\n”, pPEB);**

> **if (pPEB->BeingDebugged != 0) {**

> **printf(“\[\*\] PEB->Being Debugged: 0x%d\\n”, pPEB->BeingDebugged);**

> **printf(“\[\*\] Debugger Detected!! \\n \[+\] Patching the PEB \\n”);**

> **PEBPatcher();**

> **}**

> **printf(“\[\*\] PEB should have been Patched\\n “);**

> **printf(“\[\*\] PEB->Being Debugged: 0x%d\\n”, pPEB->BeingDebugged);**

> **printf(“\[\*\] executing our payload\\n”);**

> **MessageBoxW(NULL, L”PATCHED SUCCEED!! “, L”HELLO FRIEND! “, MB\_ICONERROR | MB\_OK);**

> **return EXIT\_SUCCESS;**

> **}**

**Code Walkthrough**

*   **Retrieval**: The C code retrieves the PEB address through getPEB.
*   **Debugger Check and Patch**: If BeingDebugged is 1, indicating that a debugger is present, it calls PEBPatcher() to reset the flag to 0.
*   **Final Message**: The program confirms successful patching with a message box, simulating payload execution in an undetected state.

**Section 5: Proof of Concept (POC)**

To validate the patch, here’s an image showing the output of the patched process. This confirms that the BeingDebugged flag has been successfully modified, allowing the process to continue without debugger interference.

Steps to confirm the patch:

1.  **Debugger Output**: Without patching, a debugger would detect and react to BeingDebugged = 1.
2.  **Post-Patch Behavior**: After running PEBPatcher, the flag resets to 0, as shown in the POC output, indicating the patch is successful.

**Conclusion**

Bypassing debugger detection through **PEB->BeingDebugged** patching demonstrates how we can work around anti-debugging techniques in Windows. This approach is useful in security analysis and reverse engineering contexts, especially when dealing with heavily protected applications or malware.

#### Other fields within the PEB can similarly be patched or manipulated to influence process behavior. Exploring these fields can open new ways to understand and counteract anti-debugging strategies.
